## THE FRONT END


## Implement all these features based off the prototype

 - [ ] Creating TO-DO list. Also make calender.
 - [ ] Logger
 - [ ] Ability to upload pictures
 - [ ] Homepage that welcomes the user. 

More to come... (Maybe put up motivating quotes from Andrew Tate or some other stuff)

Perhaps a feature to recommend training programs based on the user circumstances.
